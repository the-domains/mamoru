**Mamoru** provides a global immutable proof of ownership and proof of proximity for any high-value portable item. When you register your possession, like a bicycle, using our easy smartphone app, your ownership of the item is written to the [Ethereum][0] blockchain, for ever, linking you to your possession via the chip inside it. Thefts can easily be reported and the item recovered. 

Theft is an unfortunate fact of life, but the opportunity to prove your ownership and track your item adds a new, revolutionary layer of security and protection for the things you love.
